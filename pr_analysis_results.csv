"3","feat: Bulk Patient Import - CSV parsing with job tracking and clinic isolation","2","Tests cover controller endpoints and input validation but mock all core business logic including CSV parsing, data transformation, row validation, and transaction handling which are headline features in the PR title; actual implementation of parseCSV, transformPatientData, validatePatientRow, and importPatients transactions are completely untested.","2","Entire service and helper layers are completely untested due to heavy mocking; wrong implementations of CSV parsing, transaction handling, clinic isolation, and validation would all pass the existing controller-only tests.","1","Minor issues with unrelated configuration variables (REMINDER_SERVICE, REVENUE_CACHE) added to .env.example and formatting noise (trailing commas) in routes/v1.js; otherwise well-structured with clear separation of concerns across model, service, controller, and helpers.","1","Patch implements all core functionality (CSV parsing, job tracking, clinic isolation, transactions, 26 tests) but includes minor unrelated changes in .env.example (4 config flags for unrelated features: REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED, REMINDER_MAX_RETRIES, REVENUE_CACHE_TTL, REVENUE_MAX_RANGE_DAYS) and formatting changes in routes; also defines IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE and MAX_IMPORT_ROWS in env but does not implement chunking logic in service.","1","Tests are syntactically clear with good structure and descriptive names, but some test names in the 'Business Logic' section suggest comprehensive coverage (e.g., 'should enforce clinic isolation', 'should track total rows') while only checking parameter passing or mocked return values, creating a misleading impression of scope."
"4","feat: Medicine Interaction Checker - bidirectional severity detection and risk scoring","2","Tests cover controller handlers but completely mock service layer (8 methods) and helpers (11 functions); model ENUM and bidirectional logic are untested; core business logic like calculateSeverityScore, isCriticalInteraction, and bidirectional detection have zero actual test coverage despite being headline features in the issue.","2","The service and helpers layers are entirely mocked; wrong implementations in business logic (e.g., bidirectional check removed, severity calculation broken) would pass all tests since only controller validation is actually verified.","1","Mostly clear and well-structured with excellent separation of concerns across model, service, controller, helpers, and validation; however, .env.example includes unrelated configuration for other features (reminder service, revenue cache, import settings) mixed with the relevant medicine interaction configuration.","1","All core requirements implemented including bidirectional detection; risk scoring; 36 tests; 7 controller handlers; but includes 6 unrelated environment variables in .env.example (REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED; REVENUE_CACHE_TTL; IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE; etc) that are not mentioned in the issue","1","Tests are syntactically clear and well-organized but several test names suggest comprehensive business logic coverage (e.g., 'should normalize medicine IDs', 'should calculate combined severity', 'should maintain bidirectional interaction checking') while the bodies only verify controller delegation to mocked services without validating the actual business logic behavior; this creates initially misleading expectations about what is being verified."
"5","feat: Subscription Feature Gates - tier-based access control with bulk operations","2","Tests verify controller HTTP handling with mocked dependencies but completely skip testing the 11 service methods and 11 helper functions that contain the core business logic; only 1 of 3 mentioned helpers is actually used","2","Service layer with 11 methods is entirely mocked and unverified; helpers are mocked; core business logic like feature access checks, bulk operations, and statistics calculation can be completely wrong and tests will still pass.","1","Main implementation is well-structured with clear separation of concerns; however routes/v1.js and .env.example include unrelated modules (appointmentReminders; revenueAnalytics; bulkPatientImport; medicineInteractionChecker) not mentioned in the PR description","2","Patch fully implements subscription feature gates (model with category ENUM/resetFrequency/usageUnit, 11 service methods, 9 controller handlers, helpers, tests) but includes significant unrelated changes (appointmentReminders, revenueAnalytics, bulkPatientImport, medicineInteractionChecker modules with routes and env vars)","0","Tests are well-organized with clear describe blocks; descriptive test names accurately reflect the setup-action-assert pattern; mocking strategy is explicit and easy to follow."
