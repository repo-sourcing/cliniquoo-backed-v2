 {"score": 2, "reason": "The service and helpers layers are entirely mocked; wrong implementations in business logic (e.g., bidirectional check removed, severity calculation broken) would pass all tests since only controller validation is actually verified.", "analysis": "The test file mocks both `service.js` and `helpers.js`, meaning the actual business logic in 11 service methods and all helper functions is completely unverified. I can construct multiple wrong implementations that pass: (1) Service `checkInteraction` ignores parameters and returns hardcoded values - passes because mocked; (2) Service removes bidirectional lookup (only checks medicineId1 < medicineId2 order) - passes because mocked; (3) Helper `calculateSeverityScore` returns wrong scores - passes because mocked; (4) Service `calculateCombinedSeverity` always returns 'low' - passes because mocked. The tests verify controller validation (Joi schemas) and parameter passing, but the core business logic layers are entirely untested. This matches the rubric criterion 'an entire code layer is unverified' and 'DB mocked so wrong queries pass'."}
