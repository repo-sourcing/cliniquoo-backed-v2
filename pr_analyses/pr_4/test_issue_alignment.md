 {"score": 2, "reason": "Tests cover controller handlers but completely mock service layer (8 methods) and helpers (11 functions); model ENUM and bidirectional logic are untested; core business logic like calculateSeverityScore, isCriticalInteraction, and bidirectional detection have zero actual test coverage despite being headline features in the issue.", "analysis": "The issue explicitly claims: Model with severityLevel ENUM and bidirectional behavior, Service with 11 methods, Helpers with calculateSeverityScore/isCriticalInteraction/groupBySeverity, and Controller with 7 handlers. The test file has 37 tests that thoroughly cover the 7 controller handlers with proper validation, error handling, and response format testing. However, the tests completely mock the service layer (`jest.mock('../service.js')`) and helpers (`jest.mock('../helpers.js')`), meaning zero actual testing of: checkInteraction bidirectional logic, checkMultipleInteractions, getHighRiskInteractions, createInteraction, updateInteraction, deactivateInteraction, calculateCombinedSeverity, calculateSeverityScore, isCriticalInteraction, groupBySeverity, or the severityLevel ENUM definition. The test 'should maintain bidirectional interaction checking' only verifies the controller calls service with specific params - it doesn't test the actual bidirectional database query logic in the service. This is a classic case of testing the HTTP wrapper while ignoring the core business logic explicitly named in the issue requirements."}
