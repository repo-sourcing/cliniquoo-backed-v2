 {"score": 1, "reason": "Tests are syntactically clear and well-organized but several test names suggest comprehensive business logic coverage (e.g., 'should normalize medicine IDs', 'should calculate combined severity', 'should maintain bidirectional interaction checking') while the bodies only verify controller delegation to mocked services without validating the actual business logic behavior; this creates initially misleading expectations about what is being verified.", "analysis": "The test file follows a clear structure with descriptive describe blocks and uses standard Jest patterns (beforeEach, mocks, expect.objectContaining). However, there is a consistent pattern where test names imply validation of business logic features (normalization, bidirectional checking, severity calculation, pagination, sorting) but the implementations only assert that the controller calls the service and returns HTTP 200/201. For example, 'should normalize medicine IDs on creation' only checks status 201 without verifying the service received normalized IDs; 'should support pagination on warnings' doesn't verify limit/offset parameters are passed to the service; 'should sort high-risk interactions by severity' only asserts that sortByRisk was called rather than verifying sorting behavior. This mismatch between test names and actual verification creates confusion about whether the tests validate business logic or merely controller wiring. The tests are readable and syntactically correct, but the scope is trivially narrow compared to what the names suggest, making them potentially misleading to developers trying to understand system behavior or debug failures."}
