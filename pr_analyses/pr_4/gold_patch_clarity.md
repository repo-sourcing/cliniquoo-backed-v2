 {"score": 1, "reason": "Mostly clear and well-structured with excellent separation of concerns across model, service, controller, helpers, and validation; however, .env.example includes unrelated configuration for other features (reminder service, revenue cache, import settings) mixed with the relevant medicine interaction configuration.", "analysis": "The PR demonstrates excellent code organization with a clear MVC pattern: model.js defines the Sequelize schema with proper indexes and the severityLevel ENUM; service.js contains 11 methods handling business logic including bidirectional interaction checking; controller.js provides 7 HTTP handlers with proper validation; helpers.js offers utility functions for severity scoring and formatting; and validation.js defines comprehensive Joi schemas. The test file includes 36 behavioral tests covering edge cases, validation errors, and business logic. The only clarity issue is in .env.example, which mixes the relevant medicine interaction configuration (MEDICINE_INTERACTION_CHECK_ENABLED, MEDICINE_INTERACTION_CACHE_TTL) with unrelated feature flags (REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED, REVENUE_CACHE_TTL, IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE, etc.), suggesting either incomplete cleanup or scope creep. Routes are properly integrated in v1.js following existing patterns."}
