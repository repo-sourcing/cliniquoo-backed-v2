 {"score": 1, "reason": "All core requirements implemented including bidirectional detection; risk scoring; 36 tests; 7 controller handlers; but includes 6 unrelated environment variables in .env.example (REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED; REVENUE_CACHE_TTL; IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE; etc) that are not mentioned in the issue", "analysis": "The patch fully implements the Medicine Interaction Checker feature as specified: severityLevel ENUM with low/moderate/high/critical values; bidirectional detection via OR query checking both medicine ID orderings and ID normalization on creation; risk scoring through calculateSeverityScore and calculateCombinedSeverity; all 7 controller handlers (checkInteraction; checkMultipleInteractions; getWarnings; getHighRiskInteractions; createInteraction; updateInteraction; deactivateInteraction); all required helpers (calculateSeverityScore; isCriticalInteraction; groupInteractionsBySeverity); and exactly 36 behavioral tests covering validation; business logic; and error cases. The only deviation is in .env.example which adds 6 unrelated configuration variables (REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED; REMINDER_MAX_RETRIES; REVENUE_CACHE_TTL; REVENUE_MAX_RANGE_DAYS; IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE; MAX_IMPORT_ROWS) alongside the 2 relevant ones (MEDICINE_INTERACTION_CHECK_ENABLED; MEDICINE_INTERACTION_CACHE_TTL). These unrelated changes are minor but present; warranting a score of 1 rather than 0."}
