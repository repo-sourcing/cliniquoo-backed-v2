 {"score": 2, "reason": "Tests mock the entire service and helper layers allowing any wrong implementation in business logic database queries and utility functions to pass; only HTTP delegation is verified", "analysis": "The test file contains controller-level integration tests that heavily mock service helpers and models. This creates zero coverage for: (1) Service layer logic including template duplicate detection queue processing with retry logic email stats calculation and clinic isolation in database queries; (2) Helper functions including template parsing with placeholder replacement retry time calculations with exponential backoff and email validation; (3) Model definitions and database interactions. Wrong implementations that would pass include: calculateNextRetryTime returning null regardless of strategy; parseTemplate returning unmodified template strings; processQueue marking all emails as failed without attempting delivery; getEmailStats computing incorrect success rates; retryFailedEmails ignoring the max attempts limit; and sendEmailNow skipping the actual email sending. The tests verify only that controllers call mocked services with correct parameters and return correct HTTP status codes leaving all business logic completely untested. The 'Business Logic' test section merely asserts that mocked return values are passed through not that actual business logic works correctly."}
