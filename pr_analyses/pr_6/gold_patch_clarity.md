 {"score": 1, "reason": "Includes unrelated configuration and route registrations for five other features alongside the well-structured email notification engine", "analysis": "The email notification engine module itself demonstrates excellent clarity with clean separation of concerns across models (EmailTemplate, EmailQueue, EmailLog), service (14 methods), controller (12 handlers), helpers (template parsing, retry logic), validation schemas, and comprehensive tests. However, the PR mixes in environment variable configurations and route registrations in routes/v1.js for five unrelated features (appointmentReminders, revenueAnalytics, bulkPatientImport, medicineInteractionChecker, subscriptionFeatureGates) that are not mentioned in the PR description. While the main feature is focused and well-structured, these unrelated inclusions prevent a perfect clarity score."}
