  "reason": "All 12 controller endpoints and headline features (templates; queue; retry; delivery tracking) have basic HTTP-level tests; but the explicitly-named helpers (parseTemplate; calculateNextRetryTime; exponential backoff) are completely mocked and untested; service logic for all 14 methods is mocked rather than validated; and no cross-module integration is exercised",
  "analysis": "**Claim Extraction from Issue:**\n1. Email Notification Engine (headline)\n2. Templated emails (headline)\n3. Queue with priority-based ordering (headline)\n4. Retry with exponential backoff (headline)\n5. Delivery tracking (headline)\n6. Models: EmailTemplate, EmailQueue (priority-based), EmailLog (audit trail)\n7. Service with 14 methods: createTemplate, queueEmail, sendEmailNow, processQueue, retryFailedEmails, getEmailStats (and others)\n8. Helpers: parseTemplate, calculateNextRetryTime, exponential backoff\n9. Controller with 12 handlers\n10. 33 behavioral tests\n\n**Coverage Map:**\n\n| # | Claim | Feature | Test Assertion | Verdict |\n|---|-------|---------|----------------|---------|\n| 1 | Email Notification Engine | All endpoints wired | HTTP tests via supertest across 12 routes | COVERED |\n| 2 | Templated emails | createTemplate, getTemplatesByEventType | POST /templates 201/400, GET /templates/by-event/:type 200 | COVERED |\n| 3 | Queue with priority | queueEmail, getPendingEmails | POST /queue 201, GET /pending 200; priority ordering \"test\" just checks mock-returned order | PARTIALLY COVERED |\n| 4 | Retry / exponential backoff | retryFailedEmails, calculateNextRetryTime | POST /retry returns mocked { retried: 3 }; actual exponential calculation in helpers.js never exercised | UNTESTED |\n| 5 | Delivery tracking | sendEmailNow, EmailLog | POST /send-now returns deliverTime from mock | COVERED (via mock) |\n| 6 | Models (EmailTemplate, EmailQueue, EmailLog) | model.js | jest.mock(\"../model\") — model structure/behavior never tested | UNTESTED |\n| 7 | Service 14 methods | service.js | jest.mock(\"../service\") — all service logic mocked; no service unit tests | UNTESTED |\n| 8 | Helper: parseTemplate | helpers.js | jest.mock(\"../helpers\") — helper completely mocked, never called | UNTESTED |\n| 8 | Helper: calculateNextRetryTime | helpers.js | Same — mocked | UNTESTED |\n| 8 | Helper: exponential backoff algorithm | calculateRetryBackoff | Never tested | UNTESTED |\n| 9 | Controller 12 handlers | controller.js | All 12 routes hit via HTTP tests | COVERED |\n| 10 | 33 behavioral tests | test count | ~31 tests counted — approximately matches | COVERED |\n\n**Summary:** The test suite is exclusively an HTTP-level controller test using supertest with the service, helpers, and model all fully mocked. This confirms the plumbing (routing → controller → response shape) but does not validate any business logic. The helpers explicitly named in the issue (parseTemplate, calculateNextRetryTime, exponential backoff) are never exercised. The 14-method service layer is never tested. Priority-based ordering is only asserted against a mock that returns what you tell it. All headline features have at least nominal HTTP-level coverage, which pushes this to Score 1 rather than 2, but the gap between what the issue claims was built and what the tests actually validate is substantial — confined entirely to the integration-surface edge cases and the cross-module logic layers."
