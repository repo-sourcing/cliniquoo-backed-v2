 {"score": 0, "reason": "Tests are well-organized with descriptive names following clear setup-action-assert patterns; describe blocks logically group functionality and assertions are straightforward to verify.", "analysis": "The test file demonstrates excellent clarity through consistent structure and naming. Tests are organized into logical describe blocks (Template Management, Email Sending, Queue Management, Email Statistics and Logs, Business Logic) with descriptive test names that explicitly state the expected behavior and HTTP status codes (e.g., 'should create template with valid data (201)'). The setup uses standard Jest mocking patterns with beforeEach cleanup, and each test follows a clear three-step pattern: (1) define input data and configure mock return values, (2) execute HTTP request via supertest, (3) assert on status codes and response properties. While some Business Logic tests verify mock behavior rather than actual implementation logic, the test intent remains transparent and readable. The inline route definitions in the test setup are unconventional but clearly documented, and the overall 600-line file maintains readability through consistent formatting and logical grouping."}
