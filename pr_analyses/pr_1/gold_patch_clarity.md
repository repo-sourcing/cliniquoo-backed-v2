 {"score": 1, "reason": "Minor unrelated formatting changes (trailing commas) in routes/v1.js alongside the feature addition", "analysis": "The PR adds a complete appointment reminder feature with clear separation of concerns across model, service, controller, validation, routes, and tests. The structure follows existing codebase patterns with proper clinic-level scoping and ENUM validation. However, the routes/v1.js file includes minor stylistic formatting changes (adding trailing commas to unrelated existing require statements) which constitute noise unrelated to the feature implementation. Otherwise, the diff is well-organized, focused, and easy to understand with no abandoned work or debug files."}
