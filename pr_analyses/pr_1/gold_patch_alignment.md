 {"score": 2, "reason": "Patch implements core features but misses explicitly stated clinic-level scoping requirements in get/update/delete controllers; includes significant unrelated formatting changes (trailing commas) throughout routes/v1.js; tests are present but test mocks rather than actual implementation logic.", "analysis": "The issue requests a complete appointment reminder system with clinic-level scoping, 35 behavioral tests, model, service (7 methods), validation, controller (6 handlers), and routes. The patch provides all components: 35 tests (though they test mock data structures rather than actual implementation), 7 service methods, 6 controller handlers, and proper model/validation. However, it fails to enforce clinic-level scoping in the getOne, update, and delete controller methods - these endpoints accept a clinicId in the URL but never verify the reminder belongs to that clinic, creating a security gap. Additionally, routes/v1.js contains extensive unrelated formatting changes (adding trailing commas to nearly every existing route line). The tests, while numerically matching the requirement, are trivial assertions on mock objects that don't exercise the actual service or controller logic."}
