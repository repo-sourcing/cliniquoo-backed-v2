 {"score": 3, "reason": "Tests completely fail to validate core functional requirements; they only test plain JavaScript object manipulation and mocked model behavior while the actual service (7 methods), controller (6 handlers), and validation schemas are never imported or exercised.", "analysis": "The PR claims to add a complete appointment reminder system with service (7 methods), controller (6 handlers), validation, and routes. However, the 35 tests only mock the model and test plain JavaScript operations (object property assignment, array filtering/sorting, spreading) - never importing or calling the actual service, controller, or validation modules. The tests verify that `reminder.reminderType = 'Email'` works (basic JS) but do not test that `service.update()` actually updates a record. Headline features like the service layer, controller handlers, Joi validation schemas, and route wiring have ZERO test coverage. The tests are essentially tautological - they test that JavaScript works, not that the implementation works."}
