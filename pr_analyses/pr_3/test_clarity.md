 {"score": 1, "reason": "Tests are syntactically clear with good structure and descriptive names, but some test names in the 'Business Logic' section suggest comprehensive coverage (e.g., 'should enforce clinic isolation', 'should track total rows') while only checking parameter passing or mocked return values, creating a misleading impression of scope.", "analysis": "The test file demonstrates good syntactic clarity with consistent Jest patterns, organized describe blocks for each controller method, and readable setup-action-assert structure. However, the 'Business Logic' describe block contains tests with ambitious names that imply validation of actual business rules (clinic isolation, row tracking, lifecycle transitions) but merely verify that mocked services receive correct parameters or return mocked values. For example, 'should enforce clinic isolation during import' only asserts that clinicId is passed to service.createImportJob, not that isolation is actually enforced. Similarly, 'should track total rows' validates that a mocked service response is formatted correctly, not that row counting logic works. This creates a gap between test name intent and actual validation scope that could mislead readers about true coverage. The heavy mocking strategy (services and helpers fully mocked) is clear in context but means tests validate controller delegation rather than end-to-end behavior."}
