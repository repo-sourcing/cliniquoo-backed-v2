 {"score": 1, "reason": "Patch implements all core functionality (CSV parsing, job tracking, clinic isolation, transactions, 26 tests) but includes minor unrelated changes in .env.example (4 config flags for unrelated features: REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED, REMINDER_MAX_RETRIES, REVENUE_CACHE_TTL, REVENUE_MAX_RANGE_DAYS) and formatting changes in routes; also defines IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE and MAX_IMPORT_ROWS in env but does not implement chunking logic in service.", "analysis": "The diff fully implements the requested bulk patient import feature: ImportJob model with status tracking, service methods (createImportJob, importPatients with transactions, getJobStats), helpers (parseCSV, transformPatientData, validatePatientRow), controller with 5 handlers (createImport, getImportJob, getImportJobs, getImportStats, deleteImport), csv-parse dependency, and approximately 26 behavioral tests covering validation, file handling, pagination, and business logic. Clinic isolation is properly enforced throughout. However, the patch includes unrelated configuration flags in .env.example for reminder and revenue features not mentioned in the issue, and adds trailing comma formatting changes to existing routes. Additionally, while IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE and MAX_IMPORT_ROWS are defined in .env.example, the service does not actually implement chunking logic (rows are processed individually). The controller implements 5 handlers rather than the 6 mentioned in the issue description, though all required functionality appears covered."}
