 {"score": 1, "reason": "Minor issues with unrelated configuration variables (REMINDER_SERVICE, REVENUE_CACHE) added to .env.example and formatting noise (trailing commas) in routes/v1.js; otherwise well-structured with clear separation of concerns across model, service, controller, and helpers.", "analysis": "The PR demonstrates excellent structural organization with clear separation of concerns: model.js handles data structure, service.js contains business logic with transactions, controller.js manages HTTP handlers, helpers.js provides utility functions, and validation.js defines schemas. The test file is comprehensive with 26 behavioral tests. However, the .env.example file includes configuration for unrelated features (REMINDER_SERVICE_ENABLED, REVENUE_CACHE_TTL) alongside the import-related settings, indicating minor scope creep. Additionally, routes/v1.js contains formatting changes (added trailing commas) unrelated to the feature functionality. The core implementation is clean and focused, but these extraneous changes prevent a perfect score."}
