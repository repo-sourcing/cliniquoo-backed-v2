 {"score": 2, "reason": "Tests verify controller HTTP handling with mocked dependencies but completely skip testing the 11 service methods and 11 helper functions that contain the core business logic; only 1 of 3 mentioned helpers is actually used", "analysis": "The PR claims 39 behavioral tests for subscription feature gates with service methods (checkFeatureAccess, bulkEnableFeatures, getFeatureStats, etc.), helpers (formatFeatureResponse, groupByCategory, calculateCapacity), and a model. However, the test file only tests the controller layer with fully mocked service and helpers. The actual service.js implementations (11 methods including CRUD operations, bulk updates, and database queries) have zero test coverage. Of the three mentioned helpers, only formatFeatureResponse is used in the controller; groupFeaturesByCategory and calculateAvailableCapacity are completely unused and untested. The tests validate HTTP request handling and status codes but do not verify the actual business logic, database interactions, or helper implementations. This matches rubric score 2: 'Tests only partially validate the issue. Core functional requirements are missed while tests cover peripheral concerns.'"}
