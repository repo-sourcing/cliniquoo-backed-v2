 {"score": 1, "reason": "Main implementation is well-structured with clear separation of concerns; however routes/v1.js and .env.example include unrelated modules (appointmentReminders; revenueAnalytics; bulkPatientImport; medicineInteractionChecker) not mentioned in the PR description", "analysis": "The subscription feature gates implementation itself is exemplary: clean MVC structure with dedicated model; service; controller; validation; helpers; and comprehensive tests. The code follows consistent patterns and is easy to follow. However; the PR bundles four additional unrelated modules in routes/v1.js and .env.example without mentioning them in the issue description; creating minor scope confusion. The main feature implementation remains clear and focused despite these extraneous inclusions."}
