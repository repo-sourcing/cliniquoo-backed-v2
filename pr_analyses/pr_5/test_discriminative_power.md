 {"score": 2, "reason": "Service layer with 11 methods is entirely mocked and unverified; helpers are mocked; core business logic like feature access checks, bulk operations, and statistics calculation can be completely wrong and tests will still pass.", "analysis": "The test file mocks both the service layer (`jest.mock('../service.js')`) and helpers (`jest.mock('../helpers.js')`), meaning the actual implementations of 11 service methods and all helper functions are never executed or verified. Tests follow a tautological pattern: they mock a service method to return value X, then assert the controller returns X. Wrong implementations that would pass include: (1) Service `checkFeatureAccess` always returns `hasAccess: true` regardless of database state; (2) Service `bulkEnableFeatures` actually disables features; (3) Service `getFeatureStats` returns hardcoded random numbers; (4) Helper `formatFeatureResponse` returns malformed data. None of these would be caught because the real implementations are never called. While some tests verify that controller methods are invoked with correct parameters, the entire service layer containing core business logic (database queries, access control, bulk operations) is completely unverified, fitting the rubric criterion of 'an entire code layer is unverified' for score 2."}
