 {"score": 2, "reason": "Patch fully implements subscription feature gates (model with category ENUM/resetFrequency/usageUnit, 11 service methods, 9 controller handlers, helpers, tests) but includes significant unrelated changes (appointmentReminders, revenueAnalytics, bulkPatientImport, medicineInteractionChecker modules with routes and env vars)", "analysis": "The diff completely implements the subscription feature gate management system as specified: the model includes category ENUM, resetFrequency, and usageUnit fields; the service implements all 11 mentioned methods (checkFeatureAccess, bulkEnableFeatures, getFeatureStats, etc.); helpers include formatFeatureResponse, groupByCategory, and calculateCapacity; the controller provides 9 handlers; and comprehensive behavioral tests are included. However, the patch also adds four entirely unrelated modules (appointmentReminders, revenueAnalytics, bulkPatientImport, medicineInteractionChecker) with their own routes and environment configuration variables, making this a non-atomic PR with significant scope creep beyond the issue requirements."}
