{"score": 1, "reason": "Tests are syntactically clear with consistent setup-action-assert pattern and good naming; but the 'Business Logic' describe block is misleading — its tests (uniqueness enforcement; tier hierarchy; usage limits) are actually just controller pass-through tests with fully mocked services; not validations of any real business logic.", "analysis": "The test file is well-structured overall. It uses a clean beforeEach setup, consistent req/res mock scaffolding, and most describe/it blocks have self-explanatory names that match their bodies. The mocking strategy (jest.mock service and helpers, test only the controller layer) is consistent throughout and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, there are clarity issues that prevent a score of 0:\n\n1. **Misleading 'Business Logic' section**: This describe block contains tests named 'should enforce feature uniqueness per tier', 'should handle subscription tier hierarchy', 'should support usage limits on features', and 'should track feature reset frequency'. A reader would expect these to test actual business rules. Instead, they are identical in structure to all other controller tests — mock the service return value, call the controller, check the response. 'should enforce feature uniqueness per tier' is even a near-duplicate of the 'should reject duplicate features' test in the Create Feature section.\n\n2. **'should handle bulk operations safely'**: The test name implies testing some safety mechanism or guard, but the body simply calls bulkDisableFeatures with 5 keys and checks the count in the response. There is no safety scenario being exercised.\n\n3. **'should support enabling and disabling features independently'**: This test runs two sequential operations (enable then disable) in a single test body with a mid-test jest.clearAllMocks(). The dual-operation structure and manual res reset inside the test body adds minor confusion about what assertion is the key one.\n\nThese are readability issues rather than structural failures — the tests are not confusing, just slightly misleading in scope versus naming. This fits a score of 1: syntactically clear and readable, but with narrow scope presented under names that imply broader validation."}
