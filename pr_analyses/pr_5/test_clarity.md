 {"score": 0, "reason": "Tests are well-organized with clear describe blocks; descriptive test names accurately reflect the setup-action-assert pattern; mocking strategy is explicit and easy to follow.", "analysis": "The test file demonstrates excellent clarity with 39 behavioral tests organized into logical describe blocks by functionality (Check Feature Access, Get Available Features, Bulk Operations, etc.). Each test follows a clear setup-action-assert pattern: req/res mocks are initialized in beforeEach, test cases set specific inputs, call controller methods, and assert on status codes and response structures. Test names are descriptive and match the assertions (e.g., 'should grant access to enabled features' verifies hasAccess: true). The mocking of service and helpers at the top is explicit, making it immediately obvious these are controller unit tests. Even the 'Business Logic' section, while testing through the controller layer, uses clear comments to distinguish scenarios like enable vs disable operations."}
