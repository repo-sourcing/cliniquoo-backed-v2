 {"score": 3, "reason": "Tests are tautological assertions on inline data that never invoke the actual service implementation; mocked service is imported but never called so any stub would pass", "analysis": "The test file mocks the service module (`jest.mock(\"../service\")`) but never actually invokes any service methods. All 40 tests perform basic JavaScript operations on hardcoded data rather than testing the implementation. For example: tests verify `1000 + 500 + 300 === 1800` inline instead of calling `service.getSummary()`; tests check regex patterns directly instead of testing `validation.js` schemas; tests sort inline arrays instead of testing `helpers.fillDateGaps()`. Since no code from service.js, helpers.js, controller.js, or validation.js is exercised, a completely wrong implementation (including stubs returning hardcoded values, empty functions, or functions with inverted logic) would pass all tests. The tests only verify that JavaScript's built-in operators work correctly, not that the revenue analytics feature works correctly."}
