 {"score": 1, "reason": "Minor formatting issues in routes/v1.js missing newline before router.use and .env.example missing trailing newline; test file contains 40 arithmetic tests that mock but never exercise the actual service implementation which is misleading though the overall module structure follows clear MVC separation", "analysis": "The PR adds a new revenueAnalytics module with clear separation of concerns (controller, service, helpers, validation, routes). However, there are minor formatting glitches: routes/v1.js has ');router.use(' without a newline, and .env.example lacks a trailing newline. More significantly, the test file claims '40 behavioral tests' but merely tests basic JavaScript arithmetic operations (e.g., 'const total = 1000 + 500 + 300; expect(total).toBe(1800)') rather than exercising the actual service implementation. While the module structure is clean and focused, the misleading test file and formatting issues prevent a score of 0."}
